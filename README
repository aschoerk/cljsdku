# cljsdku

Sudoku in clojure, in the beginning just small project used for learning functional and parallel programming, now an ugly user-interface but capable to create really fiendish sudoku-puzzles, if you give it enough time and processors. 

More information about it, can be found in doc/cljsudoku.*

## Usage
